# Tetris Game using Raylib
## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Tetris using the C++ programming language and the Raylib library. Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle video game where the player manipulates tetrominoes (geometric shapes composed of four square blocks) that fall down the playing field. The goal is to complete lines, which then disappear, and prevent the game board from filling up.

## Requirements
C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later).
Raylib library.
